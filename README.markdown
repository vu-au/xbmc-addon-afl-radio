AFL Radio plugin for XBMC
================================

This plugin provides a simple list of radio streams that often call AFL
games.

There is no guarantee that the streams work, but I usually find that at least
Triple M (Melb) and K-Rock work.

Installation
------------
This plugin is available as part of the XBMC CatchUp TV AU repository, but
you'll always find the latest version here.

Download the latest ZIP file from the downloads section, and put it into your 'addons' directory of XBMC. This will differ between platforms.

For Windows:
```
	%APPDATA%\XBMC\addons (e.g. C:\Program Files\XBMC\addons)
```

For Linux:
```
	~/.xbmc/addons
```

For Mac:
```
	/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Application Support/XBMC/addons
```

For AppleTV:
```
	/Users/frontrow/Library/Application Support/XBMC/addons
```
